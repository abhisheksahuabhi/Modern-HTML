**Accessibility** in HTML refers to the practice of designing and coding web content in a way that ensures it can be
easily accessed, understood, and interacted with by people of diverse abilities, including those with disabilities.
This includes using semantic markup, providing alternative text for images and videos, and making sure your
web pages are navigable using a keyboard

**Web accessibility is essential for several reasons:**

Inclusivity: Creating accessible websites ensures that all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can access and use your web content. This includes people with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and other impairments.

Legal Compliance: Many countries have laws and regulations in place that require websites to be accessible to people with disabilities. Non-compliance can lead to legal issues and penalties.

Wider Audience: By making your website accessible, you expand your potential audience. This can include individuals who rely on screen readers, keyboard navigation, or other assistive technologies.

Improved User Experience: Many accessibility best practices also enhance the overall user experience for everyone, not just those with disabilities. For example, clear and well-structured content benefits all users.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Some accessibility improvements, such as providing descriptive alternative text for images, can also have SEO benefits, as search engines rely on text to index and rank web content.

**Regarding how web accessibility benefits different user groups:**

Visually Impaired Users: Accessible websites are crucial for individuals who are blind or have low vision. Screen readers, Braille displays, and other assistive technologies rely on well-structured HTML and alternative text to convey information to these users.

Hearing Impaired Users: Closed captions for videos and transcripts for audio content benefit users who are deaf or hard of hearing. Providing visual cues for important audio information is also helpful.

Motor Impaired Users: Keyboard navigation is essential for people with motor impairments who may have difficulty using a mouse. Ensuring that all interactive elements are reachable and usable via the keyboard is crucial.

Cognitive and Learning Disabilities: Clear and concise content, simple navigation, and easy-to-understand instructions benefit users with cognitive and learning disabilities. Avoiding flashing content that could trigger seizures is also important.
