          Older HTML versions may have limited support for modern web
          technologies and features in some browsers.
        </td>
        <td>
          HTML5 is widely supported in modern browsers, providing better
          cross-browser compatibility and reducing the need for workarounds.

      <tr>
        <td>
          Older HTML versions did not support WebSockets for real-time
          communication or Web Workers for multi-threading.
        </td>
        <td>
          HTML5 introduced WebSockets for efficient, bidirectional communication
          and Web Workers for running scripts in the background, improving
          performance and responsiveness.
        </td>

      <tr>
        <td>HTML lacked built-in mechanisms for offline storage.</td>
        <td>
          HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, allowing
          web applications to store data locally on the user's device, even when
          offline.
